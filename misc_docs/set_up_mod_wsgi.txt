Setting up mod_wsgi on Mac running python 2.6 with Django 1.4.1

##NOTE:
Before you start the process below be sure that your directories and subdirectories aren't named the same.
In Django 1.4.1, when you start a project with "django-admin.py startproject example_site" it creates the
following file structure - where/your/django/code/resides/exmaple_site/example_site/...

To get mod_wsgi working I had to rename it to ../projects/example_site/...

##DOWNLOAD AND SETUP http.conf
- Download the mod_wsgi.so file from http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/downloads/list
- Copy the file to /usr/libexec/apache2
- In /etc/apache/httpd.conf add "LoadModule wsgi_module     libexec/apache2/mod_wsgi.so"

##USING A VHOST
- In etc/hosts create an entry for your vhost (I created one for 'dev.python.com' at 127.0.0.1)
- In /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf, I created a virtual host -

<VirtualHost *:80>
    DocumentRoot "/Users/kenny.chan/Sites/py_fwk/projects/mysite"
    WSGIDaemonProcess dev.python.com python-path=/Users/kenny.chan/Site/py_fwk/projects python-eggs=/Users/kenny.chan/Site/py_fwk/projects/mysite/eggs
    WSGIProcessGroup dev.python.com
    WSGIScriptAlias / /Users/kenny.chan/Sites/py_fwk/projects/mysite/mod.wsgi
    ServerName dev.python.com
    <Directory "/Users/kenny.chan/Sites/py_fwk/projects/mysite">
      AllowOverride All
      Order allow,deny
      Allow from all
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>

- Note the "WSGIScriptAlias / /Users/kenny.chan/Sites/py_fwk/projects/mysite/mod.wsgi" - create the mod.wsgi file.  The first "/" after WSGIScriptAlias
basically says that the mod.wsgi applies to the base directory
- You can actually setup different wsgi files for different URLs
Ex. WSGIScriptAlias /blogs /Users/kenny.chan/Sites/py_fwk/projects/mysite/blogs.wsgi
- I'm setting WSGI to run as a daemon using WSGIDaemonProcess...
- I'm not sure what WSGIProcessGroup does.


##CREATING THE WSGI file (for my case mod.wsgi)
- add the following into the mod.wsgi

##START OF mod.wsgi

import os, sys
sys.path.append('/Users/kenny.chan/Sites/py_fwk/projects')
os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = 'mysite.settings'
os.environ['PYTHON_EGG_CACHE'] = '/Users/kenny.chan/Sites/py_fwk/projects/mysite/eggs'

import django.core.handlers.wsgi

application = django.core.handlers.wsgi.WSGIHandler()

##END OF mod.wsgi

- You need to state the absolute path to your projects foldder.  When Django runs you can't really tell where the Apace user
is running the code from so you can't use relative paths. I kept getting an error saying it couldn't find my settings file
because I was using a relative path.

- Set the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE
- Set the PYTHON_EGG_CACHE - this dir needs to be already created and have write permissions

- Remember to restart Apache
