##ASSUMES YOU HAVE AN EXISTING MYSQL DB

- We need to have Django sync up the legacy database

- Create Django app (gbbm/good_beer/good_beer/) called bad_movie
----command = 'python manage.py startapp bad_movie'

- cd into bad_movie

- run command  = 'python ../../manage.py inspectdb > models.py'

- you may need to clean up the models.py (e.g change max_length value to 255)

- you may need to rearrange the classes in the correct order

- in your settings.py be sure to include the new app (bad_movie) to your
----'INSTALLED_APPS' setting

- run '../../python manage.py syncdb'
